## Project Overview

This long-term project invites you to propose, implement, evaluate, and present
your own advanced project in the field of computer security. In addition to
requiring the completion of a significant and innovative software tool, this
project invites you to complete a series of presentations and reports. Your
proposed project should clearly demonstrate a "security synapse" both through
the connection between high-level concepts and their low-level implementation
and technical concepts discussed in the course and their practical application
to the secure use of real-world computer software. You may use external sources,
including artificial intelligence coding assistants and online forums, during
the completion of this project provided that you cite these sources and explain
how you used them to complete the various components of your proposed project.

## Proposal Instructions

Provide all of the requested details about your proposed security summit
project. Please note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository
has a passing build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have
adequately answered all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to
each of them. It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory
answers to all of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment of
your security synapse project proposal.

TODO: You should delete all of the prompts in this file so as to ensure that the
final document is a comprehensive proposal for your security synapse project.

## Security Summit Project Proposal

### Add Your Name Here

TODO: Make sure to include your name in the above heading.

### Summary Checklist

TODO: Please create a filled checkbox for each proposal task that you completed

TODO: Please do not fill in the checkbox if you did not complete the task

- [] Explored various topics in the field of computer security
- [] Provided an informative title for the proposed project
- [] Gave a list of the overall scientific and engineering goals for the project
- [] Wrote a proposal abstract with both an overview and the expected contributions
- [] Outlined a design, implementation, and evaluation strategy for the project
- [] Furnished a demonstration of project feasibility through code and/or data
- [] Gave a list of tasks that you plan to complete after the proposal's approval
- [] Explain how the project will help you to achieve learning outcomes
- [] Suggested improvement for upcoming modules in the computer security course

### Potential Topics for the Security Summit Project

TODO: Provide a list of at least three topics that you considered for this
project, bearing in mind that for the next question you will need to specify
which project you are picking at your final one for this course. It is also
important to note that if some aspect of your chosen project does not work out,
then you can consider one of these alternative projects as a backup.

TODO: Each topic in the list should be explained with one sentence that explains
both what you are going to build and how you are going to evaluate it.

#### What is the final topic that you have selected for your security summit project?

TODO: Write two or three sentences that offer an overview of your topic, explain
what you are going to build, and describe how you are going to evaluate it. What
you furnish in this sub-section of the proposal should include a few more
details than the topic list that you provided in the previous sub-section.

- **Final Topic**: 

#### What is one insight from the "Software Engineering at Google" book that you have applied to your practice of software engineering? What happened when you applied this insight?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

#### From the perspective of professional development and the content in the "Software Engineering at Google" book, what is the greatest weakness of your software engineering team? Why? How would you advise the team to improve?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

#### From the perspective of professional development and the content in the "Software Engineering at Google" book, what is your greatest weakness? Why? How do you plan to improve as this course continues?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

## Learning Objectives

After consulting the [Learning
Objectives](https://securitysynapse.org/syllabus/#learning-objectives) for the
Computer Security course, pick at least two or three of them that **connect to
your proposed computer security project** and write the learning objective in
its entirety below this paragraph. Next, accurately assess your current
attainment of that learning objective on a scale between 1 and 5 where 1
indicates that you are emerging as a learner for the objective and 5 indicates
that you are computer security engineer who expertly completes tasks associated
with the learning objective and are prepared to effectively teach it to others.

### Restatement of Learning Objectives

TODO: Make sure to re-state one of the learning objectives, using the correct
notation for its label as provided in the syllabus.

### Assessment of Your Attainment of the Learning Objective

- [] 1 (**Emerging**): The developer is beginning to learn this skill or concept
and needs significant guidance and/or support.
- [] 2 (**Developing**): The developer has some understanding but still needs
help and practice to fully grasp the skill or concept.
- [] 3 (**Competent**): The developer has a solid understanding and can
independently apply the skill or concept most of the time.
- [] 4 (**Proficient**): The developer has a deep understanding and can
consistently apply the skill or concept independently and effectively.
- [] 5 (**Expert**): The developer has mastered the skill or concept and can
apply it in complex situations and even teach it to others.

### Write three sentences that summarize your overall experience in the computer security course for this module. What do you think that we should keep doing? What do you think that we should stop doing? What suggestion can you offer for a task that we can start doing to improve the next module of the course?

#### Sentence One: Answer the question `What do you think that we should keep doing? Why?`

TODO: Write one sentence to answer the question.
TODO: Provide a sentence of the form "I think that we should keep doing X because Y."

#### Sentence Two: Answer the question `What do you think that we should stop doing? Why?`

TODO: Write one sentence to answer the question.
TODO: Provide a sentence of the form "I think that we should stop doing X because Y."

#### Sentence Three: Answer the question `What do you think that we should start doing? Why`

TODO: Write one sentence to answer the question.
TODO: Your sentence should be of the form "I think that we should start doing X because Y."
