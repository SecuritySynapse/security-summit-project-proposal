## Project Overview

This long-term project invites you to propose, implement, evaluate, and present
your own advanced project in the field of computer security. In addition to
requiring the completion of a significant and innovative software tool, this
project invites you to complete a series of presentations and reports. Your
proposed project should clearly demonstrate a "security synapse" both through
the connection between high-level concepts and their low-level implementation
and technical concepts discussed in the course and their practical application
to the secure use of real-world computer software. You may use external sources,
including artificial intelligence coding assistants and online forums, during
the completion of this project provided that you cite these sources and explain
how you used them to complete the various components of your proposed project.

## Proposal Instructions

Provide all of the requested details about your proposed security summit
project. Please note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository
has a passing build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have
adequately answered all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to
each of them. It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory
answers to all of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment of
your security synapse project proposal.

TODO: You should delete all of the prompts in this file so as to ensure that the
final document is a comprehensive proposal for your security synapse project.

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

### Lessons Learned in Professional Development

Write one sentence to summarize what you have learned about each skill in the
area of **professional development for software engineering**. Each sentence
that you write should be accompanied by at least one reference that supports
your summarization. While you are encouraged to cite content from the "Software
Engineering at Google" book, it is acceptable for you to cite any source
available online. Please make sure that every reference that you provide is to
a web site link that the instructor can reference. Ultimately, you can think of
the sentence that you write as advice that you would give to a student at the
start of the next edition of the Software Engineering course.

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the prompts in the following sections.

#### Effective Team Work

TODO: Provide at least one reference to support your assertion.
TODO: Your reference should be a URL in the "Software Engineering at Google" book
      or a reference to a reputable web site that you found online.

#### Effective Communication

TODO: Write one sentence about this skill.
TODO: Provide at least one reference to support your assertion.
TODO: Your reference should be a URL in the "Software Engineering at Google" book
      or a reference to a reputable web site that you found online.

#### Effective Knowledge Sharing

## Learning Objectives

After consulting the [Learning
Objectives](https://developerdevelopment.com/syllabus/#learning-objectives) for
the Software Engineering course, pick at least one of them that **connects to
professional development** and write the learning objective in its entirety
below this paragraph. Next, accurately assess your attainment of that learning
objective on a scale between 1 and 5 where 1 indicates that you are emerging as
a learner for the objective and 5 indicates that you are developer who expertly
completes tasks associated with the learning objective and are prepared to
effectively teach it to others.

### Restatement of Learning Objective

TODO: Make sure to re-state one of the learning objectives, using the correct
notation for its label as provided in the syllabus.

### Assessment of Your Attainment of the Learning Objective

- [] 1 (**Emerging**): The developer is beginning to learn this skill or concept
and needs significant guidance and/or support.
- [] 2 (**Developing**): The developer has some understanding but still needs
help and practice to fully grasp the skill or concept.
- [] 3 (**Competent**): The developer has a solid understanding and can
independently apply the skill or concept most of the time.
- [] 4 (**Proficient**): The developer has a deep understanding and can
consistently apply the skill or concept independently and effectively.
- [] 5 (**Expert**): The developer has mastered the skill or concept and can
apply it in complex situations and even teach it to others.
